CalcSample

 Implements a trivial commandline application with two subcommands

   * <<plus>> gets variable number of integer arguments and computes their sum

   * <<minus>> gets two integer arguments and computes their difference

 The whole implementation is so trivial that I decided to write all classes in single Java file.
