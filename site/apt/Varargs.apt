Declaring variable list of parameters

 <<Varargs>> (VARiable ARGumentS) is useful when a functionality needs to accept any number of values - unknown at development time.

 This is typical for file operations - zipping, copying, moving or doing whatever else with multiple files is quite common task.

 To declare it with <<<AnnottationAwareSetup>>>, you just equip your command class with a constructor using varargs in the latest parameter.

 An example is in {{{./MiniCalc.html}MiniCalc}} - see its subcommand <<<plus>>>.


Multiple varargs

   This feature is currently not supported.

   Future support will probably use argument "--" to separate subsequent varargs lists.
